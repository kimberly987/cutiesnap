    <h1>FAIRIES</h1>
    <h2>FAIRIES</h2>
    <h3>What is a fairy?</h3>
<p>A fairy is a type of mythical being or legendary creature, generally described as anthropomorphic, found in the folklore of multiple European cultures, a form of spirit, often with metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural qualities.</p>
<h3>Do fairies exits?</h3>
<p>Though the belief in fairies still exists to present day, there is no concrete proof for or against the existence of fairies.</p>
<h3>What powers do fairies have?</h3>
<p>Depending on which folk tradition one uses, fairies can do anything from magically transporting themselves or other beings to being able to change a being or object into something else. In short they can have the same powers as sorcerers.</p>
<h3>What are fairies known for?</h3>
<p>Fairies are often associated with plants and springtime, depicted as pure figures who possess magical powers. In the tales of fairies, they are more often than not mischievous creatures with dark and evil intentions. The Latin root word for fairy is 'fay' meaning fate.</p>
<h3>What do fairies do to humans?</h3>
<p>They often carry off children, leaving changeling substitutes, and they also carry off adults to fairyland, which resembles pre-Christian abodes of the dead. People transported to fairyland cannot return if they eat or drink there.</p>

<h3>Common Types of fairies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>PIXIES</li>

  <p>No taller than 6 inches,  the winged pixies can shape-shift the size of their humanoid form as needed. Although they can be very curious, fun-loving creatures, they do have another side. They feel a great responsibility toward other, similar-sized fairies (brownies and gherrings) and often become involved as peacekeepers.

  Pixies love flowers and gardens and, like hummingbirds, they love to sip nectar from flowers like honeysuckle. They have a very high metabolism, so they frequently enjoy high energy foods like sweets, milk, and cream.
        
  These hard-working, industrious people live in large colonies designed to ensure their safety. They build their cities high up in trees and magically cloak them, so they are unlikely to be discovered. When encountering danger, they like to face their enemy as a massive cloud of angry pixies, similar to a swarm of bees.
        
  Despite their fierce defensive posture, they are very friendly, kind and helpful to many different types of beings, including humans. Pixies can live to be 100 years old and are ruled by a king or queen.

  Pixies are one of the most common types of fairies and are the type of fae most often seen by humans.</p>
  <li>TROOPING FAIRIES</li>
  <img src="images/trooping fairies.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Trooping fairies are generally similar in appearance to brownies (see below) and do not have wings. In fact, a brownie we spoke to told us trooping fairies are actually brownies that troop together in long lines. This formation often happens when they are going to war.

    Trooping fairies tend to be a bit different from the average brownie. They are more serious, organized and sophisticated in lifestyle compared to the more rustic, and friendly brownie.
    
    To stay out of sight, trooping fairies prefer to travel through the woods where there is a lot of underbrush.  Some people also believe they inhabit trees which are often referred to as “fairy trees.”</p>
    <li>BROWNIES</li>
    <img src="images/brownies.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This brave, adventurous type of fairy can reach a height of 6 inches tall.  In their world, they are also known as “nims” but are more commonly known as brownies from wearing brown clothing and living close to the earth. They do not have wings but are quite capable of getting to high places when needed, with the help of a bird or one another.  In the wild, brownies live in the woods or high grass where they often build hidden or underground homes.  They do this to protect themselves from beings who are larger and more powerful than they are.

        Brownies are very social and prefer to live together in towns or large family groups. They scavenge to survive and spend their days hunting for food, household goods, and other items they can use for trade. When it comes to humans, they are usually friendly with those who are like-minded.</p>
        <li>FAUNS</li>
        <img src="images/fauns.jpg" alt="">
        <p>With horns on his head,  a human torso and the body of a goat below the waist, the faun is a unique creature. Found in woodland forests, fauns tend to be alluring, seductive and quite compelling. To get what they desire, they often prey upon their unsuspecting victims by using mind control and magic they’ve conjured from their pipes or flute.

            According to the elves, if you see a faun, you should avert your eyes because as soon as they have your attention, you are under their control.  They are neutral but can be very dangerous.</p>
            <li>MERFOLK</li>
            <img src="images/merfolk.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Commonly known as mermaids and mermen, those we have spoken with prefer to be known as mer, or merfolk.  Unlike humans, this type of fairy does not live in structures or houses. They swim together as a family unit but are also part of a larger community united under one ruler. Merfolk spend much of their day together hunting for fish, and other sea creatures to eat. They intentionally have large families because living in the sea is very dangerous and many of their young do not make it to adulthood.

                Lately, the mer have been more visible in our world because they are concerned with the overwhelming number of oil spills and pollution that has seeped into their world from our world. They are generally unhappy about this pollution and destruction of their waters and they tend to hold humans wholly responsible. Right now, the point they are trying to communicate to us is that the health of the oceans affects us all.</p>
